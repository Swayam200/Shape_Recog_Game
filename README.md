# Shape Recognition AI Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ§   
Shape Recognition AI Game is an interactive Python-based game that combines drawing, machine learning, and fun. Players are challenged to draw specific shapes, and an AI model predicts what theyâ€™ve drawn. Earn points by drawing the correct shape!  

### Features  
Interactive Drawing Area: Use your mouse to draw shapes in a dedicated canvas.  
Machine Learning Predictions: An AI model predicts the shape youâ€™ve drawn.  
Real-Time Feedback: Get feedback on your drawings (e.g., "Correct!" or "Not quite!").  
Dynamic Learning: The AI improves over time as new shapes are added to the training set.  
Enhanced UI: Modern, visually appealing interface with rounded buttons, clear instructions, and intuitive controls.  

### Technologies Used  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries:  
-pygame for creating the interactive game UI.  
-numpy and scikit-learn for AI model training and predictions.  
-opencv for feature extraction from the drawings.

### Setup Instructions 
1. Clone the Repostiory
2. Install Required Libraries
3. Run the Game

### How to Play 
Start the Game: Run the script to launch the game window.

### Instructions
The game will prompt you to draw a specific shape (circle, square, or triangle).
Use your mouse to draw the shape inside the drawing canvas.
Press SPACE to submit your drawing.
Press C to clear the canvas if needed.
Press Q to quit the game.

### Scoring:
If your drawing matches the AI's prediction, you earn a point!
Otherwise, the AI will provide feedback on the shape it recognized.  

### Dynamic Learning 
The AI model updates dynamically with your input, improving its predictions over time.
